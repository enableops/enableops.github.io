Now you are done with the initialization and it's time to dive into
the details of your new _infra (short for infrastructure)_.

_Infra_ is where you develop, test your code as well as where your production
code runs. Its your dev and production environment.

## GitOps principle

Every infra created by enableOps service is declared as Code.
So the only way to change something (e.g. roll out new version of your app,
or add a new testing cluster) is to update the code in one of infra
repositories that were created during initializing phase. And for a little bit
more info on that topic you can watch this video:

## Building blocks

To keep it dead simple there are two components:
infra **configuration** and infra **contents**.

### Configuration

git repo `terraform-enableops-infra`

Configuration is a code for initializing all the components you have in your
infrastructure with required parameters, starting from git repositories
and up to numerous clusters. By default it includes:

- Declaration of _cloud providers_: where to run your _infra_.
- _Git repositories_: where to store your code (incl. infra related code).
- _Storage for artifacts_: where to store states, container images, etc.
- Global _variables and secrets_: global versions, global credentials.
- _Clusters/environments_: how many nodes should be in each of your cluster, etc.

Examples of when will you need to change the configuration:

- Duplicate production environment for testing purposes.
- Add code declaration for your DNS Zone.
- Create a git repository for new app.

See [how to configure infra](./how-to/configure-infra.mdx) for instructions.

### Contents

git repo `gitops-enableops-infra`

Contents is a code for declaring content of your infra, it answers
a question "what should be deployed and where". By default it will include:

- Proxy service for exposing your web apps and securing them with tls.
- Monitoring service to let you know if something is wrong with infrastructure.
- Secrets management service for better security.

Examples of when will you need to change the contents declaration:

- Add new app (e.g. redis) to your dev environment.
- Deploy a new version of your backend to production by updating version variable.

See [how to deploy](./how-to/configure-contents.mdx) for instructions.
